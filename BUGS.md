-  connected chromecast has wrong time when connected and playing a new video
- fullscreen exit with ESC after native fullscreen (intended?)
- in TvShow.vue (and movie) the background image doesn't cover but stretches
- chromecast subtitles have no name / label
- subtitles need outline
- drawing thumbwall is way too CPU intensive - why
- TvShow: episode image: sizes should be the same (snow is'nt)
