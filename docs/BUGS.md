- connected chromecast has wrong time when connected and playing a new video
- in TvShow.vue (and movie) the background image doesn't cover but stretches
- TvShow: episode image: sizes should be the same (snow is'nt)

- subtitles on chromecast need outline, and are placed too high from the bottom

- when navigating to a route that is not in the QRouteTab, the QRouteTab resets.
  It should just not change.
