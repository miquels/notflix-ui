- connected chromecast has wrong time when connected and playing a new video
- in TvShow.vue (and movie) the background image doesn't cover but stretches
- chromecast subtitles have no name / label
- TvShow: episode image: sizes should be the same (snow is'nt)

- subtitles on chromecast need outline, and are placed too high from the bottom

- QVirtualScroll always paints 30 rows of thums, it ignores virtual-scroll-slice-size.
  Reported as a bug in https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/6122,
  but closed (incorrectly, I think).
